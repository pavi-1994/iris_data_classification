classification model built on iris dataset

**1)Problem to be solved**:

To clean the data, find the missing values and visualise that our dataset is balanced with equal records for all three species on the iris dataset.


2)Data overview:
Iris Dataset â€“The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The data set consists of samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

The features present in the dataset are:
1)Id
2)SepalWidthCm
3)SepalLengthCm
4)PetalWidthCm
5)PetalLengthCm
6)Species


Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris There are 5 columns they are 'SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm' are float64 datatype and 'Species' column are object datatype. And also, it contains 150 non-null rows.
